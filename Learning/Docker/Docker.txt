Docker will save our repository on hub.docker.com
Our traditional deploy is to install java environment, tomcat server and software/hardware
Docker will help you to create an image which contains everything needed to run ur application
Like Java 8 or Java 11 or whatever version you want to, and it contains all library your API needed/dependency
So when we run command "docker run ..." image will be downloaded to our machince and local image will be created
so once it's done downloaded, it is ran as application in our machine
When imaged downloaded and running, it will call a container

We need to config an internal port for container port
For example: container run on port 5000 we wil use command -p 8000:5000 to let container run on port 8000

docker run -p 8001:5000 -d --restart=always in28min/todo-rest-api-h2:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT: command to run container whenever docker restart
docker container run -p 8001:5000 -m 512m --cpu-quota 50000 -d: run container with allowed resouce such as memory 512mb, cpu usage 50%
docker events: show all events of docker
docker stats: show status of all container for example: cpu usages, memory usages,
docker images: Show all images have been pulled from docker registry
docker image history (id): get all the step involved in creating specific image such as config java environment, build jar file
docker image remove (id): remove specific image in local machine
docker containers ls : Show all container running currently on machine
docker container ls -a : show history of container on local machince such as name,status,created,
docker container stop (id): stop the specific container with id 
docker container logs (id): show log of specific container with id
docker container logs -f (id): keep showing log of specific container with id
docker container kill (id): kill the container immediately without giving it time to stop other option unlike stop command
docker container pause/unpause e870: pause/unpause specific container
docker container prune: remove all containers
docker-compose up: run docker-compose

All the containers are managed by docker daemon or the docker engine
Docker daemon also manage docker image

Docker daemon is responsible for our local stuff and also pulling something from image repository (Docker Hub)

Official Image is like library in java

Single image can have multiple tag

Docker compose is a  tool for defining and running multi-container docker application

Localhost in docker isn't the same as localhost running on our machine

Can create a docker-compose file to contain all the config
