	Private Key: In the Private key, the same key (secret key) is used for encryption and decryption. In this key is symmetric because the only key is copied or shared by another party to decrypt the cipher text. It is faster than public-key cryptography. 
	Public Key: In a Public key, two keys are used one key is used for encryption and another key is used for decryption. One key (public key) is used to encrypt the plain text to convert it into cipher text and another key (private key) is used by the receiver to decrypt the cipher text to read the message. Now, we see the difference between them:
