What is SSL?
SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, is an encryption-based Internet security protocol. It was first developed by Netscape in 1995 for the purpose of ensuring privacy, authentication, and data integrity in Internet communications. SSL is the predecessor to the modern TLS encryption used today.

How does SSL/TLS work?
In order to provide a high degree of privacy, SSL encrypts data that is transmitted across the web. This means that anyone who tries to intercept this data will only see a garbled mix of characters that is nearly impossible to decrypt.
SSL initiates an authentication process called a handshake between two communicating devices to ensure that both devices are really who they claim to be.
SSL also digitally signs data in order to provide data integrity, verifying that the data is not tampered with before reaching its intended recipient.
